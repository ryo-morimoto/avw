## Why

<!-- Explain the motivation for this change. What problem does this solve? Why now? -->

## What Changes

<!-- Describe what will change. Be specific about new capabilities, modifications, or removals. -->

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
<!-- Capabilities being introduced. Replace <name> with kebab-case identifier (e.g., user-auth, data-export). Each creates specs/<name>/spec.md -->
- `<name>`: <brief description of what this capability covers>

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- Existing capabilities whose REQUIREMENTS are changing (not just implementation).
     Only list here if spec-level behavior changes. Each needs a delta spec file.
     Use existing spec names from openspec/specs/. Leave empty if no requirement changes. -->

## Prior Art

<!-- REQUIRED: Search openspec/solutions/ for entries related to your target capabilities.
     List relevant solutions with links, or state "No relevant solutions found."
     For each solution, check if the referenced spec has been modified since the solution date.
     Mark stale solutions with [STALE].
     Run: ls openspec/solutions/<capability>/ for each capability in scope. -->

- [solution-name](../../solutions/<capability>/<file>.md) — <what it covers>

## Impact

<!-- Affected code, APIs, dependencies, systems -->
