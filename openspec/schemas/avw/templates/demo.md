<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
     The demo artifact is constructed entirely via Showboat CLI commands.
     All content is generated by showboat init/note/exec/image.
     Run `showboat verify` to confirm reproducibility. -->

<!-- Construction steps:

1. Initialize:
   showboat init <change-dir>/demo.md "<change-name> Verification"

2. For each feature to verify:
   a. Add context note:
      showboat note <change-dir>/demo.md "Verifying: <description>"
   b. Run verification command:
      showboat exec <change-dir>/demo.md bash '<command>'
   c. For browser features (use Rodney):
      rodney start
      rodney open <url>
      showboat image <change-dir>/demo.md 'rodney screenshot /tmp/<name>.png && echo /tmp/<name>.png'
      rodney stop

3. For accessibility verification:
   showboat exec <change-dir>/demo.md bash 'rodney ax-tree --depth 3'

4. Capture Entire attribution:
   showboat exec <change-dir>/demo.md bash 'git log --format="%(trailers:key=Entire-Attribution)" -5'
   showboat note <change-dir>/demo.md "Attribution: <agent>% agent, <human>% human"

5. Verify reproducibility:
   showboat verify <change-dir>/demo.md
